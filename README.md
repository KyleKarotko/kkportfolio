Kyle K's Coding Portfolio 
This was created for the purpose of fulfilling the challenge requirements in module 2.
# Desciption
When a potential employer wants to sample my previous work they load my portfolio. When they do, they are presented with my name, a recent photo, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me. When they click one of the links in the navigation, the UI scrolls to the corresponding section. When they click on the link to the section about my work the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of my applications. When they are presented with the first application, that application's image should be larger in size than the others. When they click on the images of the applications they are taken to that deployed application. When they resize the page or view the site on various screens and/or devices they are presented with a responsive layout that adapts to their viewport
